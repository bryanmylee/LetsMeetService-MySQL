# LetsMeetService (MySQL)

A REST API and authentication service for LetsMeet, a group scheduling application.

## Depreciated

Due to hosting costs, data requirements, and the shape of the data stored, it was decided that a serverless NoSQL database built on Cloud Firestore would be the better option. Migrated to [LetsMeetService](https://github.com/bryanmylee/LetsMeetService).
